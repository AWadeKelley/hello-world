# hello-world
Starting point for onboarding to DevOps.

As you onboard to the DevOps team, please create your first application as hello-world so everyone knows you have started from the same place.
We will view this as the starting line for everyone on the team.
Our teaming approach is crawl, walk, run to make sure we all have a common understanding within the development team and associated environment.

Welcome aboard!
Chief Digital Officer
